THanks to the net librarium. I borrowed approx. 1000 effects from them so the spacing errors are because I was too lazy to format it after
THere are about 2.5 to 3 thousand random effects. They are generated fairly badly so you might get the same ones or really game breaking ones. 
If I were a better programmer that would not be a thing, but I'm not so it is.
You'll need an updated java to run it, other than that it should run on it's own but I've got no clue on that as I'm no scientist.
IF by some magic you see this than you are free to take the generator and use it, the code is all shoddyliy written so you can
borrow that too. I don't need credit. IF you use it for a game have fun, but don't take it too seriously.
